ok i just finished making a teaser for my new series that'll be about documenting my journey into building businesses in france in my 20s as a moroccan final year broke college student intern.

the thing is that i want to make it intriguing, like how daniel daalen or omar waseem or zak yadegari document their stuff ..

for the teaser it's gonna be a post about me starting this series but i don't know what to say in the caption, maybe: starting a new series.. the only way for me to stay consistent is to have my people hold me accountable or smtg like this... who's investing? :)

i will work on multiple stuff (ai startups, consumer apps, alts morocco, content...), until i figure it out, the goal is to survive and hack and do things until i find my aha moment ... 

it's pretty crazy since i'm in a city called nantes which is not well known for startups, i'm new here... and i don't know if i'll ever find builders and people who know what's going on in yc and silicon valley.. 

best case scenario, i'll get funded and create my own startup and move to sf... (and/or make alts morocco my full-time job -- or get a job in france for a startup or a company in europe..

i have 5 months to do this.. my visa will end in september this year.. the road is still unclear to me

another case: i would love to help entrepreneur first, finc, or any VC in their mission and make them better in terms of growth .. but still i want to do my own thing
