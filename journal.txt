hey.

i’m kaito. i made this thing called FreeRead.

it takes your long journal, splits it smartly, and reads it out loud using openai.fm.

that’s it.

i built it because i got tired of copying huge text into tts tools that either cut me off at 999 characters, 

try to charge me for 5 seconds of playing, 

or just froze. 

so i made something that handles that for me — splits cleanly, plays each chunk, and optionally gives me a full audio file to save later.

i like building tools like this — tiny things that solve one specific pain. not shiny. just helpful.

sometimes you wanna listen instead of read. maybe you're tired of coding all day. or you just process better through sound.

this thing helps with that.

freewrite helped me so much with writing (shoutout to farza).

and i think freeread will help with reading and listening.

that’s all. if it helps you too, amazing.

if not, that’s fine. i’ll keep making weird little stuff anyway.

aight bye.
