u know that feeling when it's nearly impossible to achieve something..

either because you're too late

or you didn't prepare enough and it has high competition

your mind and logic says: there is no way

but your brain (or soul?) says: f*ck it we do it anyway.

and somehow (most of the time) it works out!

and even if it doesn't -- u don't feel thaaat bad..

u say gg and move on.

that leap of faith is real!

i hope such happy ending occurs again in my upcoming move inshallah.

if u reading this: wish me luck homie -- will need it fr.
